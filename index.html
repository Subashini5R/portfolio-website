            <h2 class="section-two__title">About Me</h2>
            <p class="section-two__desc">I am a B.Tech graduate in Information Technology, passed out in 2025, with a
                strong interest in Full Stack
                Web
                Development. I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, Python, and MySQL, and I have applied these skills
                through
                academic and personal projects to design and develop responsive, user-friendly web applications. My
                academic
                background has helped me build strong analytical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and attention to
                detail.
                I am passionate about learning new technologies, improving my coding skills, and staying updated with
                modern
                web
                development practices. I enjoy transforming ideas into practical digital solutions and continuously
                strive
                to
                enhance my technical and professional capabilities.
                I am currently seeking an entry-level opportunity where I can contribute to real-world projects,
                collaborate
                with experienced professionals, and grow as a Full Stack Web Developer while delivering high-quality and
                impactful solutions.
